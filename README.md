Liri-Node- App

This was one hell of a HW

Topic - save keys and utilize packages and retrieve data inside the terminal from the code given
and console.log objects. Use twitter, omdpai,r eadme and spotify packages.

My steps(with tutor help)-

1- was installing the correct npm packages and retrieving keys and tokens

2- was to hide the keys from being uploaded

3- was exporting the keys to keys.js and initializing them on liri.js by using require

4-  call a function to put all the switch functions inside. The switch functions are
calling the package functions. Switch functions are called based on the hw Ex] Spotify-this

5- hardcode each function for each package from NPM and place it inside a new function
we should have a total of four functions.

6- name the function and call it inside the switch function underneath the case code I used parameters
such as type and query

7- run the codes in git bash. check for errors and json objects.

8- call the correct objects from the terminal from the console.


Mishaps
 still working on getting the correct responses from console.log.  
 stil working on the parameters from the json file.
